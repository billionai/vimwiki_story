= Belt of Giants Bane =

Wondrous Item, Rare

This belt is made out of leather that looks as though has been hit by lightning, with streaks of burned leather sprawling from the buckle, made out of a single sapphire.

Just by wearing this belt, the wearer is able to use the second set of proerties of the [[hammer_thunderbolts.wiki|Hammer Of Thunderbolts]].
Additionally, once per day, the wearer may cast a 1st level spell that deals thunder or lightning damage without using the spell slot. This ability recharges at dawn.
