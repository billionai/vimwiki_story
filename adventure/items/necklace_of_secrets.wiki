= Necklace of the Brotherhood of Secrets =

Wondrous item, Rare

This necklace has a thin chain of silver beads, and a pendant of a small diamond, in the shape of a keyhole. It is used by all initiated members of the Brotherhood of secrets, a warlock bar found in Cynesel. It is said that people with this necklace can never be deceived.

The wearer of this necklace sees through illusions as if they were translucent, automtically passing any checks related to it.
If they look at someone attempting to hide themselves using invisibility, they see the general shape (humanoid, quadruped, and so on) and size of the creature, without being able to see any identifying things about it.
Finally, if someone is attempting to hide their true form, they see the projection of the true form as a wireframe of light around them, once again, unable to detect any identifying features about the true form of the creature (i.e. a person using alter self would be noticeable, but if they changed their face, you'd not be able to see who they are).
