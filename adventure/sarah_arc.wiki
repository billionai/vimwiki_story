== Backstory ==

Her parents, Edward and Agatha, had a nice relationship. Edward was a great student of the forbidden arts, and developed a mask that could she whatever and wherever. He left detailed notes he planned on taking to the wizard's college to prove that being a warlock was no different to being a wizard, but before he could go, he was taken by the witch hunt of the village. Left in a tower until they could build a suitably spectacular bonfire for him, Edward vanished waking only half of his mask - the half that his famililar Pascal could bring.

Agatha was distraught. When the inquisition came for them, it was futile to try and save Edward, the best she could do is save herself for her 3 year old daughter, so she attempted to burn her husband's notes, but Pascal saved them for Sarah, when she was old enough.

== Explanations ==

Edward vanished into the ethereal plane with his Ethereal Shard Mask, and has been hidden in the shadows ever since. He sent Pascal to watch over Sarah and protect her. When she needed a strong spellcasting focus, Pascal did what he knew and got the mask from Edward, but because he doesn't understand it, he broke the glass that allowed the mask to see in magical darkness.

Once Sarah finds him, he'll want her to disband the secret police or discret the rumors, and will bestow the mask on her as a way to help. She will finally have a complete mask with this.
